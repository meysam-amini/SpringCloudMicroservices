Steps to Set Up the Docker Registry:
1.Pull the Docker Registry Image:
docker pull registry:2
2.Start the Docker Registry Container:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name my-registry registry:2
3.Push and Pull Images: Tag an image to point to your registry, then push it:
docker tag my-image <server-ip>:5000/my-image
docker push <server-ip>:5000/my-image
Pulling the image from your registry would be:
docker pull <server-ip>:5000/my-image

4.Secure Your Registry with Authentication and TLS, and Configure Docker Daemon to Trust Your Registry
4.1.Install NGINX on Your Server
sudo apt install nginx -y
4.2.Set Up SSL Certificates:
Option 1: Generate a Self-Signed Certificate
Option 2: Use Let’s Encrypt (if you have a domain)

4.2.1.Generate a Self-Signed Certificate
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/nginx/certs/registry.key -out /etc/nginx/certs/registry.crt
4.3.Configure Basic Authentication
sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/nginx/.htpasswd myuser
//This will prompt you to enter a password for myuser. You can add more users by running htpasswd /etc/nginx/.htpasswd otheruser.

5.Configure NGINX for Docker Registry
Create an NGINX configuration for the Docker Registry:
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker-registry
Add the following configuration:

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    #server_name your-domain.com; # or use _ if no domain
    #server_name _;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/registry.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/registry.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;

        # Basic authentication
        auth_basic "Docker Registry";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }
}

6.Enable the Configuration and Restart NGINX
Link the configuration file and restart NGINX:
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/docker-registry /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

note:
////////////////
Symbolic Link (ln -s): Creates a shortcut, meaning if you update the file in sites-available, those changes immediately apply in sites-enabled because both paths point to the same file.
                Copying (cp): Creates a separate file in sites-enabled, which means if you update the file in sites-available, you would need to copy it again to apply the changes in sites-enabled.
///////////////
sudo nginx -t
note:
///////////////
tests the NGINX configuration files for syntax errors and potential issues without actually reloading or restarting the NGINX service.
//////////////
sudo systemctl restart nginx

7.Update Docker Clients to Use the Registry
 If you’re using self-signed certificates, add the registry as an
 insecure registry on each client machine. Update the Docker daemon’s
 configuration on each client at /etc/docker/daemon.json:

///////////////////////answers:

Step 1: Dockerize the Spring Boot Application

    Create a Dockerfile for your Spring Boot application:

    dockerfile

# Stage 1: Build the Maven project
FROM maven:3.9.9-amazoncorretto-21-alpine AS build

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pom.xml and download dependencies
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline

# Copy source code and package the application
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Create the final lightweight image
FROM amazoncorretto:21

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the JAR file from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar

ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]

Build the Docker Image locally to ensure it works:

bash

    docker build -t your-username/spring-boot-app:latest .

Step 2: Set Up a Private Docker Registry

To host your Docker images, set up a private Docker registry on your server.

    Start the Docker registry:

    bash

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2

Push an image to the registry to verify:

bash

    docker tag your-username/spring-boot-app:latest localhost:5000/spring-boot-app:latest
    docker push localhost:5000/spring-boot-app:latest

    Access the registry via localhost:5000 to ensure it's working.

Step 3: Secure Your Docker Registry (Optional)

For security, use an NGINX reverse proxy with SSL and basic authentication:

    Install NGINX and configure SSL.

    Add basic authentication by generating an .htpasswd file for the registry.

    Create an NGINX configuration for the registry:

    nginx

    server {
        listen 443 ssl;
        server_name your-domain.com;

        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/registry.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/registry.key;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
            auth_basic "Docker Registry";
            auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        }
    }

    Reload NGINX after configuration to apply changes.

Step 4: Create Custom Docker Images for CI/CD

    Build a custom Maven image based on Java 21 for building the Spring Boot project:

    dockerfile

FROM maven:3.9.9-amazoncorretto-21-alpine
WORKDIR /app

Build and push it to the registry:

bash

docker build -t localhost:5000/custom-maven:latest .
docker push localhost:5000/custom-maven:latest

Build a custom Java runtime image:

dockerfile

FROM amazoncorretto:21
WORKDIR /app

Build and push it to the registry:

bash

    docker build -t localhost:5000/custom-java:latest .
    docker push localhost:5000/custom-java:latest

Step 5: Set Up GitLab CI/CD

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in your project root to define the CI/CD pipeline.

yaml

image: localhost:5000/custom-maven:latest

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "localhost:5000"
  APP_NAME: "spring-boot-app"

cache:
  paths:
    - .m2/repository

before_script:
  - echo "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password-stdin $DOCKER_REGISTRY

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean package -DskipTests
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG .
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker pull $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG
    - docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name $APP_NAME $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG

Explanation of Each Stage in GitLab CI/CD:

    Build Stage:
        Uses the custom Maven image to package the Spring Boot application.
        Builds a Docker image from the Dockerfile.
        Tags and pushes the image to the custom Docker registry.

    Deploy Stage:
        Pulls the Docker image from the registry.
        Runs the application in a Docker container on port 8080.

Step 6: Test and Run the Pipeline

    Commit your changes to the GitLab repository to trigger the pipeline.
    The pipeline should:
        Build and push the Docker image in the Build stage.
        Pull and deploy the Docker container in the Deploy stage.

Final Notes

    GitLab CI/CD Variables: Define CI_REGISTRY_USER and CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD as GitLab CI/CD environment variables.
    Ports and Profiles: Adjust ports and Spring profiles in the docker run command if needed.
    Secure Registry Access: If you use NGINX with SSL and basic authentication, set up authentication and HTTPS in the .gitlab-ci.yml.

You said:
cant we use a docker-compose -up command at deploy stage? for bringing all microservices ?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Yes, absolutely! Using docker-compose up in the deploy stage is a great way to start multiple services, especially for a microservices setup. With Docker Compose, you can define all your services in a docker-compose.yml file, including the application, database, and any other dependencies. This setup is efficient and keeps the deployment configuration organized.

Here’s how you can update the pipeline to use docker-compose in the deploy stage.
Step 1: Create a docker-compose.yml File

In the root of your project, define your services in a docker-compose.yml file. For example:

yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: localhost:5000/spring-boot-app:${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG} # Dynamic tag based on branch
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: youruser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: yourpassword
      POSTGRES_DB: yourdatabase
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  postgres_data:

This docker-compose.yml file defines two services:

    app: Runs your Spring Boot application, which will pull the image from your private Docker registry.
    database: A PostgreSQL database for the application to connect to.

Step 2: Update .gitlab-ci.yml to Use Docker Compose in the Deploy Stage

To enable Docker Compose, you need to use a Docker-in-Docker (DinD) service in GitLab CI/CD to handle container operations.

Here's an example .gitlab-ci.yml file that uses Docker Compose in the deploy stage:

yaml

image: localhost:5000/custom-maven:latest

services:
  - docker:dind

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY: "localhost:5000"
  APP_NAME: "spring-boot-app"
  DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2375
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2

cache:
  paths:
    - .m2/repository

before_script:
  - echo "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" --password-stdin $DOCKER_REGISTRY

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean package -DskipTests
    - docker build -t $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG .
    - docker push $DOCKER_REGISTRY/$APP_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - docker-compose pull                # Pulls the latest images defined in docker-compose.yml
    - docker-compose up -d               # Starts all services in detached mode

Explanation of Each Step:

    Services: docker:dind is added to enable Docker-in-Docker, which allows Docker commands to be run within the CI/CD job.
    Build Stage:
        Builds the Docker image and pushes it to your private Docker registry.
    Deploy Stage:
        docker-compose pull: Pulls the images from the registry based on the tags defined in docker-compose.yml.
        docker-compose up -d: Brings up all services in detached mode, running them in the background.

Step 3: Trigger the CI/CD Pipeline

Once you’ve committed your docker-compose.yml and updated .gitlab-ci.yml, pushing these changes to your GitLab repository should trigger the pipeline. In the deploy stage, docker-compose will start all services, including your application and database.
Tips for a Smooth Setup

    Environment Variables: Add environment variables such as CI_REGISTRY_USER and CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD in GitLab’s CI/CD settings for secure access.
    Dynamic Tagging: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG} automatically tags images based on the branch or commit, allowing for flexibility in versioning and deployment.
    Network Setup: Ensure that any dependent services (like a database) can communicate with each other. Docker Compose automatically sets up an isolated network for all services defined in docker-compose.yml.

This setup simplifies deploying multiple microservices and is easily extendable if you add more services.

Here’s a bash script that automates the creation, tagging, and pushing of both Docker images (custom-maven and custom-java) to your local Docker registry.

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Define registry and image names
REGISTRY="localhost:5000"
MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME="custom-maven"
JAVA_IMAGE_NAME="custom-java"

# Step 1: Build custom Maven image for building the Spring Boot project
echo "Building custom Maven image..."
cat > Dockerfile1 <<EOF
FROM maven:3.9.9-amazoncorretto-21-alpine
WORKDIR /app
EOF

docker build -t $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest -f Dockerfile1 .
docker push $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest
rm Dockerfile1
echo "Custom Maven image built and pushed to $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest."

# Step 2: Build custom Java runtime image
echo "Building custom Java runtime image..."
cat > Dockerfile2 <<EOF
FROM amazoncorretto:21
WORKDIR /app
EOF

docker build -t $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest -f Dockerfile2 .
docker push $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest
rm Dockerfile2
echo "Custom Java runtime image built and pushed to $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest."

echo "All images have been built and pushed to the registry."

Explanation of the Script

    Variables: REGISTRY, MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME, and JAVA_IMAGE_NAME store the registry URL and image names.
    Maven Image:
        Creates Dockerfile1 for custom-maven.
        Builds the image, tags it, pushes it to the registry, and then removes Dockerfile1.
    Java Image:
        Creates Dockerfile2 for custom-java.
        Builds the image, tags it, pushes it to the registry, and then removes Dockerfile2.
    Final Message: Confirms that both images have been successfully built and pushed.

Usage

Run the script:

bash

chmod +x build_and_push_images.sh
./build_and_push_images.sh

This script will automate building both Docker images and pushing them to your local registry at localhost:5000.
You said:
correct dockerFIle1 or 2. their just names
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

You're correct; the Dockerfiles should have been named consistently in the script for better clarity. Here’s the corrected script:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Define registry and image names
REGISTRY="localhost:5000"
MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME="custom-maven"
JAVA_IMAGE_NAME="custom-java"

# Step 1: Build custom Maven image for building the Spring Boot project
echo "Building custom Maven image..."
cat > Dockerfile_maven <<EOF
FROM maven:3.9.9-amazoncorretto-21-alpine
WORKDIR /app
EOF

docker build -t $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest -f Dockerfile_maven .
docker push $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest
rm Dockerfile_maven
echo "Custom Maven image built and pushed to $REGISTRY/$MAVEN_IMAGE_NAME:latest."

# Step 2: Build custom Java runtime image
echo "Building custom Java runtime image..."
cat > Dockerfile_java <<EOF
FROM amazoncorretto:21
WORKDIR /app
EOF

docker build -t $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest -f Dockerfile_java .
docker push $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest
rm Dockerfile_java
echo "Custom Java runtime image built and pushed to $REGISTRY/$JAVA_IMAGE_NAME:latest."

echo "All images have been built and pushed to the registry."

Changes

    File Names: Dockerfile_maven and Dockerfile_java are used instead of Dockerfile1 and Dockerfile2.
    Building and Cleaning Up: Each file is created, used for the build, and then removed afterward to keep your directory clean.

Usage

Run the script:

bash

chmod +x build_and_push_images.sh
./build_and_push_images.sh

This updated script will build and push the images with a clearer naming convention for the Dockerfiles.
